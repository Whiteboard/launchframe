#LAUNCH!

It's time for Launchframe to take advantage of the tools available.

- Composer
- Bootstrap (4)
- Bower
- NPM and Gulp
- Timber and Twig
- etc

To get started, run `bundle`, then `./start`.

Note: you should also install Composer, NPM, and RubyGems before you start. Each of these will be responsible for installing necessary things for PHP, NodeJS, and Ruby, respectively.
